# Project 2 of 5.

##I'm learning how to do small projects as part of the [Result school](https://result.school/)  marathon.

Here i learned the principle of "Drag & Drop", where everything is based on events in Java Script.

We have created a small application, a clone of [trello](https://trello.com/) .

Here a new draggeble property (class) appears in the html document.
